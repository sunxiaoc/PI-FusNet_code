'PI-FusNet_code' is a Python module that implements a three-dimensional inversion algorithm based on physics-informed networks. 
This algorithm is described in the 2025 paper titled 'Three-dimensional inversion method based on multi-source fused physical information networks for leachate distribution in landfills' by SUN et al. 
The PI-FusNet model achieves the fusion of resistivity and self-potential data.
